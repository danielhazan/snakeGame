# snakeGame

in this programm I built a running sanke game in jack language, which is simplified java-like
object-oriented programming language used in Nand2Tetris course taken in 2nd year.
in this cource we built a two layers buttom-up compiler which translates jack language 
into VirtualMachine (.vm) language (tested by vmEmulator given as a course tool), and vm language 
into assembler (which in turn being translated into binary -machine code).

in this module I supply the jack code for the snake game and its translation into vm code.
running the vm code in the vmEmulator will run the game on the emulator' screen
